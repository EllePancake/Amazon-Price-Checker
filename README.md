# Amazon-Price-Checker

This is a Python script for checking the price of a product on Amazon and sending an email notification if the price falls below a certain threshold.

## Prerequisites

## How it works

First I created a function that would scrape the name and price from my cat's favorite food on amazon. Then I create a function that could used to send myself an email and added logic that would check the price and run the function to send the email if the price hit below a specific number. I waited a few days ... 

And then I recieved an email notifying me that the price was below my threshold!

And when I clicked on the link in the email, sure enough, there was the cat food at below 25!
